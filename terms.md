# //
A single-line comment, which can have option preceding whitespace.

# <<
'Output' to specified stream.

# C++
The C programming language, improved. (++'ed) Originally developed by Stroustrup.

# comment
Documentation included alongside the source code that helps the reader understand the thoughts behind the code. Not intended to document how it works, since the code should be succinct enough to convey what it does.

# compiler
The logic that turns source code into machine code.
*a program that turns source code into object code.*

# compile-time error
An error that can be caught by the compiler, such as a missing closing quote or bracket.

# cout
The standard out stream.

# executable
Machine code compiled and linked in a machine-specific format that can be executed on that format.
*a program ready to be run (executed) on a computer*

# function
A collection of statements that perform an action within a program. A function includes the return type, function name, argument/parameter list (within parentheses), and function body containing statements to be executed during a call of the function (within curly brackets).
*a named unit of code that can be invoked (called) from different parts of a program; a logical unit of computation*

# header
The 'interface' or definition of a program's available functions that can be called.
*a file containing declarations used to share interfaces between parts of a program*

# IDE
An Integrated Development Environment, bloated with tons of features that help programmers work faster.

# #include
The statement used to import functions and variables into the current scope from external libraries (by #including their header files).

# library
A collection of functions of a similar purpose with corresponding header files that can be #included into your program.
*a collection of types, functions, classes, etc. implementing a set of facilities (abstractions) meant to be potentially used as part of more than one program*

# linker
The logic that combines the program's object code with the library's(es) binary object code into a single executable.
*a program that combines object code files and libraries into an executable program*

# main()
The first function executed when an executable is executed.

# object code
Aka machine code, the source code compiled into machine language.
*output from a compiler intended as input for a linker (for the linker to produce executable code)*

# output
That which is written out, such as the stdout stream *cout*.
*values produced by a computation (e.g., a function result or lines of characters written on a screen*

# program
The collection of code that, collectively, forms one or more executables that when run on a machine will perform actions.
*code (possibly with associated data) that is sufficiently complete to be executed by a computer*

# source code
The human-readable program which can be compiled into object code.
*code as produced by a programmer and (in principle) readable by other programmers*

# statement
A step of the program to be executed within a function.
