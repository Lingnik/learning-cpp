# <<
'Output' to specified stream.

# C++
The C programming language, improved. (++'ed) Originally developed by Stroustrup.

# comment
Documentation included alongside the source code that helps the reader understand the thoughts behind the code. Not intended to document how it works, since the code should be succinct enough to convey what it does.

# compiler
The logic that turns source code into machine code.

# compile-time error
An error that can be caught by the compiler, such as a missing closing quote or bracket.

# cout
The standard out stream.

# executable
Machine code compiled and linked in a machine-specific format that can be executed on that format.

# function

# header
The 'interface' or definition of a program's available functions that can be called.

# IDE
An Integrated Development Environment, bloated with tons of features that help programmers work faster.

# #include
The statement used to import functions and variables into the current scope from external libraries (by #including their header files).

# library
A collection of functions of a similar purpose with corresponding header files that can be #included into your program.

# linker
The logic that combines the program's object code with the library's(es) binary object code into a single executable.

# main()
The first function executed when an executable is executed.

# object code
Aka machine code, the source code compiled into machine language.

# output
That which is written out, such as the stdout stream *cout*.

# program
The collection of code that, collectively, forms one or more executables that when run on a machine will perform actions.

# source code
The human-readable program which can be compiled into object code.

# statement
A step of the program to be executed within a function.
